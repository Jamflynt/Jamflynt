### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  My name is Jamie Flynt (he/they)


A recent graduate of the Commonwealth Coders program in Kentucky, USA, I am skilled at Git, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design. I am currently teaching myself WordPress, Advanced JavaScript, Advanced CSS/SASS, UI/UX principles, and Python. I never want to stop learning and understanding as much as I can.

I am now also employed with the Commonwealth Coders program as a Front End Development Support Instructor as of January 2022! I am very excited to contribute back to the program that allowed me to make a major carreer change. 

I am currently open to freelance opportunities and looking to build my portfolio. My goal is to combine both UI/UX and design principles with a strong foundation in programming into a profitable career where I can make a difference. 

Contact me on LinkedIn, filling out the form on my portfolio site which you can find below, or via email.
