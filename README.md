### Jamie Flynt - Software Engineer


I am skilled at JavaScript, Python, React, .NET, MudBlazor, and Shopify Theme and App Development.

I am employed with the ROAD iD, Inc in Covington, Kentucky, USA as a Software Engineer. Currently, I am working in Shopify to develop/customize Themes and Apps, .NET, MudBlazor and Azure Static Web Apps, as well as anything else that is thrown our way. This also includes programming Vision Software and laser engravers.

I am not currently taking Web Development projects at this time. 

My goal is to leverage a strong foundation in backend development, with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and security, to build robust systems that drive impactful results while integrating design principles to support seamless user experiences.
