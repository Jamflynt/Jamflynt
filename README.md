### Jamie Flynt - Software Developer


I am skilled at CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, Git Version Control, and Responsive Web Design.

I am employed with the ROAD iD, Inc in Covington, Kentucky, USA as a Software Engineer as of May 2023. I currently am working with Shopify to develop/customize Themes and Apps, .NET and Azure Static Web Apps, GraphQL, as well as anything else that is thrown at me.

I am not currently taking Web Development side projects at this time. 

My goal is to combine both UI/UX and design principles with a strong foundation in programming into a profitable career where I can make a difference.
